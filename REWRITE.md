# Cookie Clicker 3 — Architectural Rewrite Status

_Last updated: 2026-08-19 (session checkpoint after Phase 2, slice 2)._

## TL;DR

Cookie Clicker 3 is a Vite-based port of Cookie Clicker 2.048 (zero runtime
dependencies, `base: './'`, GitHub-Actions deploy to
`giveen.github.io/cookie-clicker-3/`). The original conversion (commit
`3539634`) turned the game into TypeScript 1:1 by renaming files and keeping
the legacy engine verbatim under `@ts-nocheck`. That satisfied "the game is in
TypeScript" but not "the game is written in TypeScript".

This document tracks the **architectural rewrite**: restructuring the 16k-line
engine into idiomatic typed TypeScript modules and classes, with the hard
constraint that **runtime behavior stays identical to `master`** at every step.

**Current state: Phase 2, slice 2 complete.** The engine's tier table and all
19 vanilla building declarations now live in the typed content layer, and
every line of CC3's own code (glue, extras, localization, QA) type-checks
under `tsc` strict. The game builds and passes all 15 Playwright QA probes at
every commit.

## Branch / commit state

| Branch  | HEAD      | Meaning                                                        |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `master`| `dafffc6` | The finished, deployable CC3 (deploy gate). Untouched by the rewrite. |
| `rewrite` (work) | `1ab1ff5` | The rewrite, built on top of the 1:1 conversion.        |

Rewrite history (old → new):

```
3539634  Convert the full game to TypeScript (1:1 from master)   <- the rename-based conversion
3dc68fa  Rewrite Phase 1: typed engine surface + fully typed CC3 code
b2bef7e  Rewrite Phase 2 (slice 1): extract tier table into typed content layer
1ab1ff5  Rewrite Phase 2 (slice 2): extract vanilla building content into typed module
```

## What "1:1" means here, and how it's enforced

Behavior must be indistinguishable from `master`. Because the rewrite
deliberately changes file structure (and soon the engine itself), a bundle
byte-diff is no longer a viable check; the gates are:

1. **`npx tsc --noEmit`** — strict, zero errors.
2. **`npm run build`** — `tsc && vite build` must succeed.
3. **`npx playwright test`** — all 15 QA probes in `tests/qa.spec.js` must
   pass (~51 s). The probes cover: minigame boot + Garden seed, store buys,
   golden-cookie frenzy, save export/import round-trip, 4-minigame frame
   budget, ascend/reincarnate math, offline gain, Santa + Dragon specials,
   screen-reader mode, wrinkler spawn/suck/pop, one-column mode, icon
   resolution, the Black Hole Inverter extras mod end-to-end, the v3.0
   animation pass, and reduced-motion behavior.

For each content slice the moved code is additionally **diff-verified against
the original block**: the only allowed deltas are type annotations (erased at
compile time) and individually documented, runtime-preserving renames.

## What was done

### Phase 1 — typed engine surface (commit `3dc68fa`)

- **`src/engine/types.ts` (new, ~565 lines)** — the canonical engine API:
  `Game` (lifecycle, economy, layout, content maps, modding, shimmers,
  seasonals), `Building`, `Upgrade`, `Achievement`, `Buff`, `Shimmer`,
  `Wrinkler`, `Tier`, `Mod`, `Prefs`, `Art`, and the window-boundary function
  types (`LocFn`, `BeautifyFn`, `PlaySoundFn`, `AddEventFn`, `AddLanguageFn`,
  `LocalizeContentFn`). Named members are the checked contract; each type
  carries a `[key: string]: any` index signature marking the dynamic legacy
  runtime surface (the QA probes also park ad-hoc state there, e.g.
  `G.__qaAscend`).
- **`src/globals.d.ts` (rewritten)** — declares the boundary against
  `types.ts`: bare `Game`, bare `loc`/`choose` (published on `window` by the
  engine's `Object.assign(window, …)` shim — which is what makes them resolve
  at runtime inside ESM modules), the `Element.prototype.getBounds` polyfill,
  and the full `window` surface (`VERSION`/`BETA`/`App`, `AddLanguage`,
  `Beautify`, `PlaySound`, `AddEvent`, `l`, `Base64`, the CC3 glue loaders,
  `__cc3Anim`, `__cc3Binverter`).
- **All CC3-owned code retyped with zero `any`**: `src/main.ts` (1,250 lines:
  boot glue, save handling, animation polish pass, all 15 QA probe
  implementations), `src/extras/blackHoleInverter.ts` (the extras mod), and
  all 13 localization modules `src/engine/loc/*.ts` (now
  `satisfies LanguageData` — note there are **13** languages, not 12).
- `catch (e: any)` blocks in `src/main.ts` are a **deliberate, documented
  escape hatch**: legacy engine code may throw non-`Error` values, and
  narrowing them would change behavior.

### Phase 2 — content extraction (in progress)

Content is moved out of the engine's giant `Game.Init` body into
`src/engine/content/` as typed modules. The engine calls the module's
declarator function from `Game.Init`.

**Safety invariant (verified):** `Game.Init` runs **exactly once per page
load** — `Game.Loader.loaded = Game.Init` and `Loader.onLoad` is guarded by
`doneLoading` (engine lines ~832–836). Module-level content singletons
therefore have the same once-created/once-mutated lifetime as the original
inline literals, making verbatim extraction 1:1.

- **Slice 1 — tiers (commit `b2bef7e`).** `src/engine/content/tiers.ts`:
  `TIERS: Record<number | string, Tier>` — the 14 numeric tiers plus the
  `synergy1`/`synergy2`/`fortune` special tiers, transcribed verbatim.
  Engine does `Game.Tiers = TIERS` and keeps its
  `for (var i in Game.Tiers) { Game.Tiers[i].upgrades = []; }` loop.
- **Slice 2 — buildings (commit `1ab1ff5`).**
  `src/engine/content/buildings.ts`: `declareVanillaBuildings(Game)` holds
  the 19 `new Game.Object(…)` declarations (Cursor … Cortex baker) plus their
  interleaved `Game.last.*` assignments and `Game.SpecialGrandmaUnlock=15`.
  Every CpS/buy closure is type-checked (`function (me: Building)`,
  `function (this: Building)`). The engine's 308-line block is replaced by a
  single call.

Documented runtime-preserving deviations in slice 2 (all diff-verified):
local `i`→`j` loop rename in Grandma's CpS (a `var`-scope clash only visible
once typed), unused Grandma `pic` param renamed `_i`, and the Chancemaker
art literal's pre-existing **duplicate `rows` key** deduped, keeping the
last value (JS object-literal semantics).

### Type-level findings (bugs/quirks the types caught)

- `Game.Has()` returns **numeric 0/1** (`bought`), not a boolean — vanilla
  content does arithmetic on it.
- `Art` fields are all **optional** — the engine fills defaults at draw time
  (`art.h||48`, `art.rows||1`, `art.frames||1`), and Cursor passes a bare
  `{}`.
- `Art.pic` can be a **function** (Grandma's procedural sprite picker).
- `Game.Unlock` accepts `string | string[]`.
- Chancemaker art has a duplicate `rows` key in the 2.048 original.
- The 13 loc files all carry a PO header object under key `""`
  (`LanguageHeader`), which is why `AddLanguage`'s strings param is
  `Record<string, LanguageString>`, not `Record<string, string>`.

## Architecture notes / invariants to preserve

- The engine (`src/engine/main.ts`, currently 15,721 lines) is a module that
  still builds `Game` at runtime as `var Game = {}` inside one giant
  `Game.Init` body. It remains `@ts-nocheck` until Phases 3–4 restructure it;
  it can receive imports (it already imports `content/tiers` and
  `content/buildings`).
- Content ctors are called as **plain functions** (not `new`) with **string**
  building names (`TieredUpgrade(name, desc, building, tier)`, etc.);
  `.order` is assigned post-call. Keep this call style until the ctors
  themselves are retyped in Phase 3.
- `Game.last` is set by each content ctor and used by content declarations to
  attach per-building extras — it must stay populated in declaration order.
- Numeric booleans are the engine's idiom (`bought: 0/1`, `ready: 1`).
- Minigame keys `'minigameGarden.js'`, `'minigameGrimoire.js'`,
  `'minigameMarket.js'`, `'minigamePantheon.js'` are **runtime contracts**
  between the engine's `LoadScript`/module loader and the glue — they must
  not be renamed.
- The engine's `Object.assign(window, { … })` shim is what makes bare
  globals (`loc`, `choose`, `l`, …) resolve from ESM modules; any new typed
  module reading a bare engine global needs a matching declaration in
  `src/globals.d.ts`.

## What remains

### Phase 2 — finish content extraction (same proven pattern)

| Slice | Content | Size / location in `src/engine/main.ts` |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 3 | **Upgrades**: 238 `new Game.Upgrade(`, 271 `Game.TieredUpgrade(`, 35 `Game.SynergyUpgrade(`, 17 `Game.GrandmaSynergy(` | ~lines 9106–11032 (~1,900 lines incl. the tier/synergy machinery between them) |
| 4 | **Achievements**: 192 `new Game.Achievement(`, 252 `Game.TieredAchievement(`, 57 `Game.ProductionAchievement(` | ~lines 11514–12495 (~1,000 lines) |
| 5 | `Game.foolObjects` (building → joke business name/desc/icon map) + its localization loop | immediately after the building block (~line 8900 region) |

Each slice: verbatim cut → typed wrapper function → mechanical annotations →
engine wired to the call → diff-verify against original → `tsc` + `build` +
15 QA probes → commit.

### Phase 3 — core classes

Replace the runtime-built `var Game = {}` with real typed classes:
`Game`, `Building` (Object ctor), `Upgrade`, `Achievement`, plus the
tiered/synergy/production ctors. This is the step where `src/engine/main.ts`
loses most of its `@ts-nocheck`-excused surface; `types.ts` becomes the
implementation, not just the description.

### Phase 4 — systems

Retype (and restructure) the engine's systems in dependency order:
economy/CpS (`CalculateGains`, `ComputeCps`, buffs), save/load
(`LoadSave`/`WriteSave`, `toSave`, save-code import/export — **save-format
compatibility must be preserved byte-for-byte** against `master`), shimmers +
wrinklers, ascend/reincarnate, offline gain, the Loader/asset system.

### Phase 5 — minigames

Convert `src/engine/minigameGarden.ts` (2,027 lines),
`minigameMarket.ts` (1,085), `minigameGrimoire.ts` (509),
`minigamePantheon.ts` (508) to typed modules using the same boundary types.
Keep their URL keys intact (runtime contract).

### Phase 6 — verification + docs

- Full QA suite + targeted save-format compatibility checks (export a
  `master` save, import it on `rewrite`, diff the parsed state).
- Update `README.md` (architecture section), `tsconfig.json` comments, and a
  CI note (the deploy workflow is still `master`-gated by user decision —
  merging `rewrite` into `master` and deploying is a separate, explicit step).

### Housekeeping

- Retire or repurpose `scripts/transform-engine.mjs` (regenerates engine
  files from the 2.048 source used by the original conversion) and
  `scripts/scan-implicit-globals.mjs` as the engine becomes typed modules.

## Per-slice verification protocol (copy for future sessions)

```sh
npx tsc --noEmit          # strict, 0 errors
npm run build             # tsc && vite build
npx playwright test       # 15/15 probes, ~51 s (webServer: build + preview on :4173)
# diff the moved block against the original; only annotations +
# documented runtime-preserving renames allowed
git add -A && git commit -F /tmp/msg.txt   # write message via file; bash eats backticks in -m
```

Environment: Node v22.23.2, npm 12.0.2, TypeScript 7.0.2 (`tsc --noEmit`
native; `--ignoreConfig` is needed only when checking explicit file lists
against a specific tsconfig).
