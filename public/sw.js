/* Cookie Clicker 3 — service worker.
 *
 * Makes the game bootable offline: same-origin GET responses are cached on
 * first use (cache-first). Two correctness points that bit us during the
 * port:
 *   - `Cache.put()` consumes the response body, so we must hand the browser
 *     an untouched `response` and store a `response.clone()`. Returning the
 *     consumed response is what broke dynamic `import()` of the code-split
 *     minigame/language chunks ("error loading dynamically imported module").
 *   - every cache operation is best-effort (try/catch) so a cache failure
 *     can never turn into a failed fetch.
 *
 * Deploy updates: CACHE is stamped at build time (the cc3:stamp-service-worker
 * plugin in vite.config.ts) — `__BUILD__` becomes a content hash of the built
 * dist/, so every changed build gets a new cache name. Returning clients then
 * see the changed sw.js on their next navigation, install the new SW, and its
 * activate() drops the old cache. With a static cache name the browser would
 * never update the SW (byte-identical script) and the cache-first index.html
 * would pin the previous build on every installed client forever. In dev this
 * file is served as-is with the literal placeholder; the SW only registers in
 * production builds, so the placeholder never becomes a live cache name.
