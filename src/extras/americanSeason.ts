/* American Season — a CC3 extras mod (native port of klattmose's
 * "American Season" v1.8, a CCSE mod listed at
 * https://sushi8756.github.io/Cookie-Clicker-Guide/).
 *
 * This is a faithful, self-contained re-implementation built on the engine's
 * OWN content constructors (Game.Upgrade / Game.Achievement) and the mod API
 * (Game.registerMod / registerHook). It does NOT depend on the CCSE framework:
 * the CCSE helpers the original used were thin wrappers around these same
 * engine functions plus the CCSE-era extension surfaces the engine provides
 * natively — Game.customStatsMenu / Game.customOptionsMenu (dispatched in
 * ui/menu.ts after the menu DOM is replaced), the mod hooks 'logic', 'reset',
 * 'cps' (runModHookOnValue in main.ts), 'check' and 'ticker' (the vanilla
 * modHooks['ticker'] dispatch in systems/ticker.ts) — and the vanilla season
 * system (Game.seasons + Game.computeSeasons/computeSeasonPrices in
 * systems/seasons.ts), which CCSE.NewSeason used by calling exactly those two
 * functions after adding Game.seasons[name].
 *
 * How it works: "Explosive biscuit" triggers the American season for 24
 * hours (and the season is the calendar base season July 1-7, as in the
 * original). While the season is on, rockets fly up from the bottom of the
 * screen (a new 'rocket' shimmer type); clicking one earns a minute of cookie
 * production (or more, with "High explosive") and sometimes unlocks one of
 * the 11 firework upgrades, which also drop on the vanilla Keepsakes
 * heavenly-upgrade roll (the upgrades were appended to Game.seasonDrops, as
 * in the original). While the season is on, a canvas in the left panel
 * renders a full fireworks simulation (hold the mouse down in the left panel
 * to launch one manually; "inhibits clicking wrinklers" exactly as the
 * original, since the canvas covers the left panel). Four achievements
 * reward popping rockets and collecting the upgrades.
 *
 * The content is declared in init(), which runs at launchMods() — AFTER the
 * vanilla content exists (so 'Bunny biscuit', "Santa's dominion", 'Starburst'
 * anchors, 'Keepsakes' and 'Hide & seek champion' are present) and BEFORE
 * BeautifyAll(), so dname/ddesc get filled in by the engine exactly like
 * vanilla content. The mod's own save()/load() carries the fireworks config
 * (the original's 28-key defaultConfig, verbatim) + rocketsPopped as JSON;
 * the seasonal trigger state itself persists through the vanilla save
 * (Game.season / Game.seasonT are vanilla save fields).
 *
 * Assets: img/customIcons.png (the upgrade/achievement icon sheet),
 * img/rocket.png (the shimmer sprite) and snd/rocketLaunch.mp3 /
 * snd/rocketBoom.mp3 are klattmose's original artwork, vendored into
 * public/ (the original referenced the same files on klattmose.github.io).
 * The original's explicit `Sounds[url]=new Audio(url)` preload is omitted:
 * the engine's PlaySound creates the Audio on first use, and the files are
 * local. Everything else is verbatim logic.
 *
 * Credit: content, design and assets by klattmose (original CCSE mod).
