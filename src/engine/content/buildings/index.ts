/**
 * content/buildings/ — the vanilla building declarations, one file per
 * building.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from the 2.048 engine (engine/main.ts, the //define objects
 * block inside Game.Init). This is the architectural rewrite's typed content
 * layer: the same `new Game.Object` calls, in the same order, with the same
 * CpS/buy closures — only the file moved, and every closure is now typed.
 *
 * The engine calls declareVanillaBuildings(Game) from Game.Init (which the
 * asset-Loader guarantees runs exactly once per page load), so the closures
 * capture the same Game object the original bare-global references resolved to.
 *
 * CALL ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: Game.Objects key order is the building save
 * index (Cats is appended last on purpose, so old saves keep every existing
 * building at its original index), and the per-building blocks rely on
 * `Game.last` plus previously declared buildings. Never reorder the calls
 * below without checking save compatibility.
