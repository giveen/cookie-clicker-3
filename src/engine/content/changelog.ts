	'<div class="title">04/09/2026 - soundtracks and a music picker</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; Settings now has a music section: pick between the original soundtrack and the new Towns set (7 tracks from the same composer, Bert Cole), and choose exactly which track plays from a dropdown — your soundtrack and track are remembered between sessions, and each soundtrack resumes its own last track</div>'+
	'</div><div class="subsection update">'+
	'<div class="title">04/09/2026 - hold-to-buy, announcement dialogs, and smoother panels</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; click and hold a building in the store to buy it over and over — the current bulk amount applies (Ctrl/Shift), the hold stops the moment you release, slide off the row, open a menu or can\'t afford the next one, and the repeats never double-buy your final click; a new "Hold to buy" option in Settings turns the feature off entirely</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; milestone announcements are now centered dialogs (like the welcome popup) instead of notification toasts: the daily crumb collect and the transcendence completion summary — they still fall back to a toast when another dialog is already open or an ascension animation is running</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; minigame panels now ease open and closed, anchored to where you clicked; the Doctrine view and the heavenly tree got the same eased full-screen takeover</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the Cracking cookie\'s crumble got a visual pass: the crack starts hairline and widens like the ascension intro, chunks fly tighter, the faint gray box is gone, and click particles and wrinklers stay visible above the cracked cookie</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; store rows that haven\'t changed are no longer rewritten on every refresh, keeping purchases snappy even in a full store grid</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; fixed the Cat Colony panel not refreshing when the cat count changes</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the cat room is lighter on the eyes and the CPU: the herd draws at most 30 cats, only every eighth one walks the floor (none run or jump), and sprites update a touch slower</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; golden cookie Building specials can now pick cats: "Purrfect synergy" boosts and wrath-cookie "Catnapped" slows your CpS (previously this crashed the cookie click)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; new rare golden cookie effect "Zoomies": with 10+ cats, a golden cookie can send clicking power x777 for 7 seconds while the whole cat room tears around in delight — rarer than Click frenzy, and also spawnable from Decide Your Destiny</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; wrath cookies can now inflict "Hairball" on cat owners (10+ cats, 25% chance): cat production x0.1 for 30 seconds while every cat in the room stops to cough — the rest of your bakery is unaffected</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; Decide Your Destiny now survives corrupt or hand-edited saves</div>'+
	'</div><div class="subsection update">'+
	'<div class="title">02/09/2026 - performance pass</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; background music now loads lazily: nothing is fetched until you first play a track (previously the browser downloaded all ~12&nbsp;MB of music on page load, even with music off), and the next track is pre-buffered for gapless auto-advance</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the cookie counter and per-second readout are now updated in place instead of being rebuilt from HTML every frame</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; tiled backgrounds (milk, tall backgrounds) are painted with native canvas patterns instead of per-tile draw loops</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; sprite lookups no longer scan the loaded-asset list on every draw, and the remaining autosave work is scheduled during idle time</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the icons sprite sheet is preloaded during boot and is no longer downloaded twice under different cache-busting URLs</div>'+
	'</div><div class="subsection update">'+
	'<div class="title">01/09/2026 - purchase feedback, copy-to-clipboard</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; every building now gets a short grounded bounce on purchase (not just Grandma) — the store-wide feedback the roadmap called for</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the Export save prompt now has a "Copy to clipboard" button so you can grab the save code without manually selecting the textarea</div>'+
	'</div><div class="subsection update">'+
	'<div class="title">01/09/2026 - challenges, a roomier store, and cozier minigames</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added 4 new challenge modes (pick one when ascending): <b>Trigger finger</b> (scroll over the cookie = click it, no clicking achievements), <b>Ascetic</b> (golden and wrath cookies never spawn), <b>Monoculture</b> (the first building you buy locks in your only building type for the run), and <b>Spender</b> (no upgrades may be purchased, buildings only). Each has a completion shadow achievement that permanently unlocks a reward heavenly upgrade: Scrolling adept (+2% click power, +5% golden effect duration), Golden heart (+15% duration, +5% spawn frequency), Unity (+1% CpS per 100 of your most-owned building), and Minimalist (+2% CpS per 100 prestige upgrades owned)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the building store is no longer a single column: buildings now sit in a staggered, overlapping grid that fills the box, so far more of them are visible at once; also fixed the Mines\' back rows looking transparent and made farms/mines rebuild their sprites when the sprite sheet loads</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the heavenly upgrade tree now derives its layout automatically from the upgrade parent graph, and you can rearrange it with clickable presets (Auto / By branch / By generation / Grid) plus drag-to-reposition — the layout saves with your game</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; Grandma\'s Sitting Room redesigned: the cramped 6&times;6 activity-button table became a proper room layout — seat cards in a 3-column grid with each seat\'s activity icon and stats, a labelled Cozy/Eldritch activity shelf with per-activity comfort and yarn rates, a clearer comfort bar, and card-style shop rows</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; Cat Colony got the same visual pass: expedition cards with cat-sprite poses and stat chips (cats, duration, treats, risk), color-coded roster chips for idle/away/resting cats, and card-style shop rows</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; built-in extras (American Season, Casino, Daily Crumb, Black Hole Inverter, Decide Your Destiny, Tutorial) no longer award the "Third-party" achievement on every page load — a genuinely third-party mod still does</div>'+
	'</div><div class="subsection update">'+
	'<div class="title">31/08/2026 - a fuller heavenly chip shop</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added 12 low-tier heavenly upgrades (2-30 chips): Blessed apron, Second helping and Angelic recipe (+cookie production), Firm handshake and Demonic hustle (+clicking), Morning bells (golden cookies appear more often), Sugar glaze (golden cookie effects last longer), Patient tongue (golden cookies stay longer), Night watch (offline earnings), Bargaining table (buildings 1% cheaper), Tidy pantry (upgrades 1% cheaper) and Lucky start (start each run with 3 free cursors)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the Ascend confirmation now offers a "Browse the tree" option: view the heavenly upgrades without ascending (nothing resets, no chips earned) — and you can even buy upgrades with the chips you already have. The Reincarnate button becomes a "Back to game" button while browsing</div>'+
	'</div><div class="subsection update">'+
	'<div class="title">23/08/2026 - cookie clicker 3</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; Cookie Clicker 3: the 2.048 engine, rebuilt as strictly typed TypeScript ES modules on a Vite build — same game, same numbers, same puns</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; saves stay byte-compatible with Cookie Clicker 2.048 (verified by an automated export/import round-trip)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; no ads, no trackers, no CDN requests — every script, image, font and sound is self-hosted</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the game now boots offline (PWA), with a self-updating service worker</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added the Cats building (with roaming animated cats), 24 cat upgrades, and a full achievement set — 14 tiered, 3 production, 1 level, plus cat-count milestones up to 1,000</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; muting the Cats store now leaves a little sleeping cat (breathing, tail-flick and zzz) in the muted-icons bar</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added the cat synergy system: 8 cat upgrades (Kitten grandmas, Farm cats, Miner cats, Worker cats, Space cats, Golden cats, Altered cats, Time cats) that each make Cats twice as efficient and boost their building +1% per (id-1) cats, plus the "The purr-fect match" achievement for owning all of them</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added the Black Hole Inverter building, a native mod with 17 upgrades and 18 achievements</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added Decide Your Destiny: spend sugar lumps to choose the outcome of the next natural golden cookie (a native port of klattmose\'s mod)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added American Season: a July 1st season with rockets and a left-panel fireworks canvas (a native port of klattmose\'s mod)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added background music (8 tracks by Bert Cole) and interface tones, with Music and volume settings</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; rebalanced the late-game building tail back onto the ~2.1x-per-store-step price curve, checked by a full building balance audit</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added economy analysis tooling (Game.AnalyzeEconomy / Game.SimulateStrategy) behind the ?qa=content probe</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added rolling save backups (history, restore and download from the Options menu)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added one-column responsive mode for phones — the "todo!" Orteil left in the 2.048 CSS, now completed</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; the v3.0 animation pass: display-rate smooth cookie counter, slide-in columns and notifications, ascend-intro flash + shake (all disabled by "Fancy graphics" off or the OS reduce-motion setting)</div>'+
	'<div class="listing">&bull; added a Content-Security-Policy; deploys are gated by a 21-probe Playwright CI on GitHub Pages</div>'+
