/**
 * systems/music.ts — CC3 web background music (not in 2.048's browser build).
 *
 * 2.048's browser version has no music at all: `Music` stays `false`, the
 * "Music in background" pref and the jukebox's track section are Steam-only
 * (`App`-gated), and `Game.jukebox.tracks` is never populated. CC3 adds a
 * small music player here that implements exactly the interface the vanilla
 * jukebox already drives — `Music.tracks[name] = { name, author, audio }`,
 * `setVolume`, `playTrack`, `pause`, `unpause`, `loop`, `setFilter`, `cue`,
 * `next` — so the existing (Steam-only) jukebox track UI works unmodified in
 * the browser once its `if (App)` gate is relaxed to `if (Music)`.
 *
 * Tracks are MP3s in public/snd/music/, composed by Bert Cole
 * (bitbybitsound.com) — see CREDITS.md for the required attribution. Each
 * track gets its own HTMLAudioElement (created lazily by the engine's Audio
 * wrapper), looped by default; auto-advance to the next track happens on
 * 'ended' when `Game.jukebox.trackAuto` is on.
 *
 * CC3 perf: the elements exist from init (the jukebox reads
 * `tracks[name].audio` synchronously), but their `src` is only assigned on
 * first `playTrack(name)` — until then the browser fetches nothing, so a
 * visitor who never enables music downloads none of the ~12 MB of tracks,
 * and a visitor who does downloads them one at a time. When a track starts,
 * the next track in the list is pre-buffered (src assigned, not played) so
 * jukebox auto-advance stays gapless.
 *
 * CC3 soundtracks: tracks are grouped into soundtracks (the Original OST and
 * the Towns set from the same 16-Bit Starter Pack), and the player plays one
 * soundtrack's pool at a time. The choice persists in localStorage
 * (`cc3_musicSoundtrack`, `cc3_musicTrack`) — NOT the prefs bitfield, which
 * is byte-locked for save compatibility. `names` exposes the active pool so
 * the jukebox list, `next()`, auto-advance and pre-buffering stay inside it;
 * `allTracks` keeps every registered track so switching soundtracks can
 * re-point the pool without losing element state. Browsers block audio
 * before a user gesture, so the engine starts the first track from a
 * one-time pointerdown/keydown listener (Game.prefs.bgMusic is the on/off
 * switch, save-backed in the existing prefs bitfield).
