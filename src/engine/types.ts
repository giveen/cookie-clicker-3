/**
 * types.ts — the typed surface of the Cookie Clicker 3 engine.
 *
 * The 2.048 engine (src/engine/main.ts) is a 16k-line 2022-era script: one
 * runtime-built `Game` object plus a bag of globals. This file defines the
 * TypeScript surface that all CC3-owned code (entry, config, extras, language
 * modules, build tooling) compiles against — and, in the phased rewrite, the
 * surface the class-based engine is built to.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *  - The legacy engine uses numbers where modern code uses booleans
 *    (`bought: 0/1`, `ready: 1`). Those are typed as `number`, not `boolean`,
 *    so the types describe the real engine, not an idealized one.
 *  - Index signatures (`[key: string]: any`) mark the genuinely dynamic
 *    corners of the legacy engine (objects built at runtime, string-keyed
 *    maps, ad-hoc mod properties). Named members are typed and checked; the
 *    index signature only covers what the engine really treats dynamically.
