/* Cookie Clicker 3 — the typed global boundary.
 *
 * The engine (src/engine/main.ts, a port of the 2.048 classic script) is a
 * runtime-built `Game` object plus a bag of globals. The modern glue code
 * (src/main.ts, config.ts, engine/base64.ts, extras/) talks to it through
 * `window` and one bare global. This file declares that boundary against the
 * canonical engine surface defined in src/engine/types.ts, so the glue stays
 * fully type-checked.
 *
 * Where the legacy engine extends the DOM at runtime (Element.prototype
 * .getBounds) or assigns to bare globals (Game), that is declared here too.
